    <h1>About NASA Space Sonification</h1>
    <p>
        The NASA Space Sonification project is a fascinating initiative that allows individuals to explore the
        universe through sound. By translating complex 3D space datasets into auditory experiences, this project
        aims to provide a unique and immersive way to understand and appreciate the wonders of the cosmos.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project leverages advanced instruments and sophisticated techniques to convert astronomical data into
        sound, providing users with a different perceptual path to explore space objects and phenomena.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to make the universe more accessible and engaging to a wide range of audiences, from space
        enthusiasts to scientists. By combining science, technology, and creativity, we hope to inspire curiosity
        and foster a deeper connection with the cosmos.

<!-- Sonification of Data -->
<h1>Sonification of Data</h1>
<p>Image Sonification is the transformation of image into sounds. It helps to interpret visual data through sounds.</p>

<!-- Steps involved in sonification -->
<h1>Steps involved in sonification</h1>

<!-- Step 1: Fourier Transformation -->
<h1>Step 1: Fourier Transformation</h1>
<p>To generate a variety of sounds, we need Fourier Transformation of sound clips to make sine waves that can be used with varying frequencies. It generates complex sounds with the help of a combination of various sine waves of different frequencies.</p>

<!-- Step 2: Pixel-to-Sound Mapping -->
<h1>Step 2: Pixel-to-Sound Mapping</h1>
<p>Pixel values (RGBL) are mapped with the properties of sounds. And so the sounds are generated according to the scene and color composition of the present frame.</p>

<!-- Step 3: Combining Waves -->
<h1>Step 3: Combining Waves</h1>
<p>Detail the third step of combining the waves extracted from each frame. Discuss the orchestration of this combination, akin to composing a symphony.</p>

<!-- The Frame area selection -->
<h1>The Frame Area Selection</h1>
<p>In our solution, we have selected 2 square borders which are producing stars sounds when they go through the frames. Calculation of the percentage composition of RGB in each frame to produce background sounds.</p>
